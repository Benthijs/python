## Handwritten-DIP-Prototype
# Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a python library that specifically focuses on preprocessing digital images such that they can easily be inputted into deep learning models (note that this project is still in the very early stages). One of the primary goals of this software is to protrude handwritten text from the image.
# Applications
This project was created purely for educational purposes.
# Pre-requisites
* **Python 2.6+ (so far tested with python 2.7) to download python visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/**
* **Libraries**
  - Numpy
    - `pip install numpy`
  - Matplotlib
    - `pip install matplotlib`
# Example usage
`cd /path/to/Wonderland-LSTM/Handwritten-DIP-Prototype` (the directory encompassing the program)

Then run: `python sample_use.py`

Once executed an image titled `extractedFeatures.jpg` should be created in the same directory. `imagepreprocessing_prototype.py` is the main file and `onedlinearregress.py` is a helper file.
# Issues
* **Needs to be optimized.**
* **Functions such as the commented image stretcher do not work.**
* **The originally proposed functionality is yet to be implemented.**
# License
The MIT license included within the root of the repository.
